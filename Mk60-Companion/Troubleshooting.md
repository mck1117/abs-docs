## Connection

#### Help, I can't connect!

_[See connection guide here first!](Configuration.md)_

- Remove and re-pair the Bluetooth device
- Try a different laptop. macOS seems to have more reliable Bluetooth behavior than Windows.
- Try USB, as its more reliable than Bluetooth

#### Okay, I tried that, and I still can't connect.

1. Disconnect from the car, and pop open the case
1. While holding the pushbutton labeled `Bootloader`, connect USB (then release the button). Red/green/yellow lights should flash in sync.
1. Attempt a firmware update [as described here](Configuration.md)
