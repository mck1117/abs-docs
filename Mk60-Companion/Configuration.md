## Configuration

<!-- todo: how to connect to controller -->

1. Select the type of ABS controller you're using.
1. If using the PWM speedometer output, configure how many pulses should be output per kilometer traveled. This may require some experimentation to get the scaling right.
1. Rotation direction (MK60E5 only). The defaults here should be correct for an MK60E5 from a BMW E8x/E9x.
